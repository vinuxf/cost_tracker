## Cost Tracker

Cost Tracker is a robust expense tracking program built with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, ArrayList, object parsing, and advanced OOP concepts such as generics. This application enables users to efficiently manage and categorize their expenses, providing functionality to add, display, categorize, and calculate the total of their expenses.

### Key Features:
1. **Expense Management:** Allows users to add, categorize, and display their expenses with ease.
2. **Category Categorization:** Enables users to categorize expenses for better organization and analysis.
3. **Total Calculation:** Provides functionality to calculate the total expenses across all categories.
4. **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes a strong OOP design with ArrayList and object parsing for efficient data management and manipulation.
5. **Generics:** Incorporates advanced OOP concepts like generics for enhanced flexibility and reusability of code.

### How to Use:
1. Launch the Cost Tracker program.
2. Use the provided interface to add your expenses, specifying the amount and category.
3. View your expenses categorized by different categories.
4. Calculate the total expenses across all categories as needed.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java:** Core programming language used for application logic and functionality.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Utilized to design a modular and scalable expense tracking system.
- **ArrayList:** Data structure used for efficient storage and manipulation of expense data.
- **Generics:** Leveraged for enhanced code flexibility and reusability.

### Future Enhancements:
- Integration of additional features such as data visualization for expense analysis.
- Implementation of user authentication and data encryption for enhanced security.
- Enhancements to the user interface for improved user experience.
